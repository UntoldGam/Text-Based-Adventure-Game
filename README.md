# Text-based Adventure Game

## The Brief
Create a text-based game like Zork.
Have the program:
- take the user's name and use it to tell the story. Have the program allow progression through the various rooms. The user should have at least 2 choices per room.
- Have each room as a separate sub program.
- Add an inventory system â€“ they can collect objects to use in other rooms.
- The state of the game can be saved and loaded.

## Design

Use flowcharts or pseudocode to design each part of the game.

## Write

Use Python (similar to the OCR Exam Reference Language) to write your game.

## Test

Use trace tables, test plans and suitable test data to test your game.

## Refine

Use your trace tables, test results and written code to refine your game.
